chennael main 'get_user_details' message publish kar phir subscribe main utha client main , then 

client main getpass.user function chala , then response channel main publish karde usko. phir alexa ko response channel se read karega

when you send respnse to any requet type make json 
keyword for request 
{


first get the passcode
then get the channel name from server/digital ocean 
identify the intent in alexa only that means basically no major change in jarvis_test.py except teh new functionalities 


now suppose 
case 1: Oen 

{
	"intent": open_folder
	"value" : foldernmae
}
respective chanenel 

cleint {jarivis_recieve_end.py}
 if {intent is open
}
go the open functions

waha get cuurent_path detials and append the value to the current path 
then you show this new updates path in the clent browser
response will be sent by publuishing to pubnub to jarvis_test_sending.py like this :
request_type : 'open_folder' , response : 'Hey it is open' }
 

 MAIN THING TO BE KEPT IN MIND

 client side me you need to have the jarivis test logic
